# Memory Match Universal Windows Application
###### Pauric Boyle, G00316554

## Introduction
This is a project for the module Mobile Applications Development 2. The idea of the app is to be a game for kids to match the pictures.

## Functionallity
They're three levels to this game. 

Easy Level- In this level there is no time limit or move limit all you have to do is to find all the pairs
Medium Level- In this level you have got to complete the level in 15 or less moves. 
Hard Level- In this level you have to complete the board in 30 seconds 

## Obstacles 
One of my main obstacle was printing the pictures out to screen randomly and only to have two of each pictures. I used lots of different 
algorithms with no luck but in the end I ended up using Lists to store the image location name and the pictures name and then looped through 
the images and pictures list while deleting the current picture from the list and keep doing this until the list is empty and all pictures
have been printed.

#### Improvments
I would improve this app if given the time so that there would be local storage of high scores and add in animations. I would also try make the
levels hard to add more interest to it.
